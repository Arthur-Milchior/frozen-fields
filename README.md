## Frozen Fields Add-on for Anki

**Overview**

*Frozen Fields* allows you to conveniently sticky and unsticky a field right from the note editor:

New in this release are a number of shortcuts for controlling the state of your fields:

- <kbd>F9</kbd> – toggle field between frozen and unfrozen
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>F9</kbd> – toggle status for all fields

You can customize these shortcuts by editing the script. A list of all possible key assignments can be found [here](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/qt.html#Key-enum).

**Limitations**

Toggling the state of a field via the mouse will cause the editor to jump around in some cases.
