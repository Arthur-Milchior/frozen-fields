### OVERVIEW

Anki supports **sticky fields**. A sticky field is a field whose value is not deleted when you switch to a different note. This can be very useful if you are making many notes in which a field either has the **same value** or changes very little.

Unfortunaly, marking a field as sticky is quite complex and breaks your workflow. Frozen Fields allows you to conveniently mark a field as sticky (freeze) or not sticky (unfreeze) **right from the note editor**. It’s much more convenient than the default way. 

To freeze/unfreeze a field, just **click the adjacent snowflake** or use the corresponding **hotkey** (`F9` by default). A blue snowflake means that the field is frozen and a grey snowflake means that the field is unfrozen.

### HOTKEYS

- `F9`: toggle field between frozen and unfrozen
- `Shift + F9`: toggle status for all fields
