*Frozen Fields* allows you to conveniently **sticky and unsticky a field** right from the note editor:

**OVERVIEW**

Anki supports **sticky fields**. A sticky field is a field whose value is not deleted when you switch to a different note. This can be very useful if you are making many notes in which a field either has the **same value** or changes very little.

Unfortunaly, marking a field as sticky is quite complex and breaks your workflow. Frozen Fields allows you to conveniently mark a field as sticky (freeze) or not sticky (unfreeze) **right from the note editor**. Itâ€™s much more convenient than the default way. 

To freeze/unfreeze a field, just **click the adjacent snowflake** or use the corresponding **hotkey** (`F9` by default). A blue snowflake means that the field is frozen and a grey snowflake means that the field is unfrozen.

**HOTKEYS**

- `F9`: toggle field between frozen and unfrozen
- `Shift + F9`: toggle status for all fields

**LATEST CHANGES AND NEWS**

*2019-04-25* **v2.0.2**

Please note that the field handling in Anki's editor has been subject to a lot of changes in recent releases. Because of that, Frozen Fields for Anki 2.1 will only work well on Anki 2.1.12 and up. If you are experiencing issues with the editor formatting please make sure to upgrade your Anki version before filing a bug report.

*2018-08-05* **v2.0.0**

This is the first public release of my fork of Tiago Barroso's *Frozen Fields* add-on. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to all of what he has done for the Anki community over the years.

This update is meant to carry on his legacy by adding Anki 2.1 support, refactoring some parts of the codebase, and fixing a few smaller issues. All of this was made possible through the generous support of a fellow Anki user who would like to remain anonymous.

An overview of the most important changes in this release follows below:

- **New**: Anki 2.1 compatibility
- **New**: Hotkey for toggling all fields (default: `Shift+F9`)
- **New**: Configurable hotkeys
- **Changed**: Field toggles only appear when adding notes (having them available in the browser or while editing cards didn't make much sense)
- **Fixed**: Fix rare instances of snowflake icon being pasted into fields (thanks to [Dmitry Mikheev](https://github.com/ankitest/)!)

**CONFIGURATION**

The hotkeys can be customized by either using Anki 2.1's inbuilt add-on configuration screen (*Tools* â†’ *Add-ons* â†’ select *Frozen Fields* â†’ click on *Config*), or by manually editing the corresponding config keys in `frozen_fields/meta.json` in Anki's add-on folder (Anki 2.0) [the config.json file contains the default values and **should not be modified**.].

**SUPPORT**

Please **do not report issues or bugs in the review section below**. I can only reply to your reviews in a limited fashion, so this is not a good way to strike up a dialog and track issues down. Instead, please report all issues you encounter either by creating a bug report on [GitHub](https://github.com/glutanimate/frozen-fields/issues), or by posting a new thread on the [Anki add-on support forums](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/add-ons). Please make sure to include the name of the affected add-on in your report title when you do so.
